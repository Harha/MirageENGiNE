MirageENGiNE
============
MirageENGiNE is a 3D game engine, it is written using C++ as the main language. For now, only OpenGL is supported as a GPU API.

This software is in a very early stage of development. It is initially written solely for my own needs.
Thus, please keep in mind that the coding practises used here are highly experimental and probably generally considered bad.
I will be refining this project slowly over time, polishing the code that I want to keep and deleting / rewriting parts I don't like.
